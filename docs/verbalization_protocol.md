# E13-rev2 Cross-LLM Verbalization Task — Instructions

You are participating in a controlled experiment.  A deterministic
pipeline has analyzed a corpus of papers and exported a machine-computed
**evidence package** for one location on its knowledge map — the attached
`evidence_point_<x>_<y>.json`, as produced by `code/make_evidence.py`.
No real paper occupies that location.  Your task is to write the
**virtual document**: a description of the research that *would* occupy
it.

Evidence terms are **whole words**, deterministically reconstructed from
the corpus text (each entry lists its attested `word_forms`).  No
fragment decoding is needed.

The package contains:
- `theme_lens_L2` — words indicating the local research theme.
- `concentration_lens_L1` — words whose probability mass is locally
  concentrated; each carries `df`, the number of corpus documents
  containing the word, and, where `df <= 3`, its `source_docs`.
- `contributing_documents_top3` — the highest-weighted neighboring
  papers (titles and weights).
- `mixture_entropy_H`, `effective_contributing_documents`,
  `relative_uncertainty_u` — how broad and how well-supported the
  location is.

## Rules (binding)

1. **Theme from the theme lens.**  Build the consensus research theme
   from the L2 words and the contributing documents.  Words appearing
   in BOTH lens lists carry the greatest weight.  Titles of
   contributing documents may help you interpret the words, but the
   description must not be a paraphrase of those titles.
2. **Serendipity from the concentration lens, graded by df.**  Words
   appearing only in the L1 list are candidates for speculative
   additions.  If `df >= 4`: you may present the word as an emergent
   shared topic.  If `df <= 3`: you may mention it ONLY as a
   single-source hypothesis, explicitly citing its `source_docs`
   (e.g. "as explored in only one neighboring study [doc 18]").
   Never present a `df <= 3` word as established regional knowledge.
3. **No outside facts.**  Do not assert anything the evidence package
   does not support.  Your general knowledge of composites may be used
   to connect the evidence into fluent prose, not to add claims absent
   from it.
4. **Use every listed word or account for it.**  All terms in the
   package are corpus words that survived a noise filter; none is a
   bibliographic fragment.  If you nevertheless judge a term
   unusable, say so explicitly in one line rather than silently
   dropping it.
5. **Close with the evidence list.**  End your answer with a section
   `Evidence used:` listing every word you relied on, each with its
   df, plus any term you set aside under Rule 4.

## Deliverables

- **Task A**: the virtual document, in English, 200–280 words,
  structured as a research abstract (topic, approach, expected
  contribution).  Include a one-line caveat reflecting
  `relative_uncertainty_u` and `effective_contributing_documents`.
- **Task B**: a 45-word summary of the same virtual document.

Output Task A, then Task B, then the `Evidence used:` list.  Do not
include anything else — no reasoning trace, no extra sections.
